"""
Real-world scalar field data: multiple user-supplied or online-fetched
layers over an actual geographic bounding box, as an alternative to the
synthetic town in data.py. Feeds the same generic Morse engine
(geoai_agent/morse_topology.py) the synthetic fields do.

Two ways to get a layer's data onto the analysis grid:
- User-supplied scattered (x, y, value) samples -- a CSV with an x,y,value
  header, or an ESRI shapefile (POINT geometry + a "value" attribute
  field, as a .zip bundling .shp/.shx/.dbf) -- interpolated onto the grid
  with inverse-distance weighting (pure numpy, no scipy; shapefile
  parsing uses pyshp, a small pure-Python library with no further
  dependencies). A layer can also carry a free-text description of what
  it measures, passed through to the LLM recommendation step.
- Online fetch, live at request time (nothing is ever pre-downloaded or
  cached to disk): any of several free, keyless Open-Meteo endpoints --
  terrain elevation, or a live current-conditions weather variable
  (temperature, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, surface pressure).
  This is deliberately not elevation-only: OPEN_METEO_VARIABLES is a small
  registry so the same fetch/analysis path works for whichever topic a
  query is actually about (see prompts.REALWORLD_QUERY_EXTRACTION_SYSTEM
  for how a query is mapped onto one of these).

Elevation specifically has a second live source: USGS's 3DEP Elevation
Point Query Service, genuine LiDAR-derived data (often truly ~1m
resolution, vs. Open-Meteo's fixed ~90m SRTM) but US-only and queried one
point at a time rather than batched. It is tried FIRST by default within
the continental US (see build_real_world_dataset's elevation_source="auto"),
falling back to Open-Meteo automatically if USGS fails or the location is
outside its coverage -- see fetch_usgs_elevation_field.

A "slope" layer (gradient magnitude of elevation) is derived for free from
whatever elevation data is loaded, giving a second genuinely real layer
even when the user supplies nothing else -- a concrete demonstration of
the multi-layer path.

    OPEN_METEO_VARIABLES entries). If omitted entirely, defaults to
    fetching elevation online.

    layer_descriptions optionally maps layer name -> a free-text
    explanation of what it measures, carried through on the returned
    dataset for the caller to pass to an LLM recommendation step (custom
    uploaded layers have no built-in meaning the way "elevation" does).

    elevation_source picks which live source an online-fetched "elevation"
    layer comes from:
    - "auto" (the default): prefer USGS 3DEP (see fetch_usgs_elevation_field
      -- genuinely higher precision, often ~1m, but US-only and much
      slower, one HTTP request per point) ONLY when it can actually
      deliver the requested resolution -- its practical point-count cap
      (MAX_USGS_GRID_RESOLUTION) is far tighter than Open-Meteo's, so
      silently capping a fine request down to fit USGS would mean e.g. a
      "100m pixels" request quietly comes back much coarser instead. A
      request that needs a finer grid than USGS can serve goes straight to
      Open-Meteo (fast, global, ~90m, much higher point-count ceiling),
      which can actually get close to what was asked. Either way, if the
      chosen primary source fails outright (rate limit, outage, no 3DEP
      coverage), the other is tried as a fallback before giving up.
    - "usgs": USGS only, no fallback -- fails outright if USGS does.
    - "open_meteo": Open-Meteo only, no fallback -- for when the higher
      precision isn't worth the wait.
